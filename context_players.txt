Gavin Grigar.  Rumours that he is washed up may not be true.  He has won this tournament in previous years. He is currently part of the World Champions Team USA.
Tom Guan will.  Possibly a Chinese spy.  No life outside of warhammer.  Previous ITC champion.  He is currently part of the World Champions Team USA.
Aaron Elias Newbom is a past champion of this event.  But only plays bad armies so he has an excuse when he loses.
Matt Nguyen.  19% win rate.  Terrible player.  His favourite army, Beasts of Chaos, are no longer legal.
Brian Horton.  Best player is Southern California.  But only plays one army.  Needs to expand.
Frederick Schmidt.   If there was a prize for talking, he'd be champion.
