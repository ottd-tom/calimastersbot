ROUND SCORING AND PLACINGS
This tournament uses capped battle point difference as the tournament ranking tiebreaker system (after number of wins). Each round, the difference between your opponent’s score and your score added to 20 (capped between 0 and 40) will be the tournament score for that round. 
For example:
If the score of your game is 46-38, your round score will be 28.
If the score of your game is 32-50, your round score will be 2.
If the score of your game is 44-18, your round score will be 40.
If the score of your game is 24-50, your round score will be 0.


In the event of a tie between multiple players’ tournament scores after five rounds, opponent’s win percentage will be the second tiebreaker.


When entering your score into BCP, please enter the actual game result. BCP will calculate the capped battle point score automatically for you. Enter the number of battle tactics scored as well.


PAIRINGS
Pairings will be random in the first round. The second through 4th rounds will be random within win bracket. The final round will be swiss (top-down) pairings.
ROUND TIMING
Each round is 3 hours.


If a game has not reached a conclusion by the end of the round, the players must come to an agreement (math-hammer) on who would win and which auxiliary objectives would be scored if the game had concluded 5 full battle rounds. If agreement can not be made, a TO should be informed, and the TO’s decision will be final.
PLAYER CONCEDES
If a player concedes, they receive a major loss and their opponent receives a major victory. Their opponent also scores all possible remaining battle tactics and denies all remaining battle tactics.
For example, if player A concedes after the top of turn 2 (having taking turn 2), their opponent would score 4 rounds of battle tactics [rounds 2,3,4,5], plus 3 rounds of denies [rounds 3,4,5], plus any points they had already achieved for battle tactics up until that point.
PLAYER TABLED
If a player is tabled, the game does not immediately end. The remainder of the game should be played out, or the players should come to an agreement (math-hammer) on who would win and which auxiliary objectives would be scored if the game had concluded 5 full battle rounds.
________________




LATE ARRIVALS AND BYES
   * If more than one player arrives late for the first round, the late arrivals will be paired against each other.
   * If there is an odd late arrival in the first round, they will receive zero points.
   * If a player arrives more than 15 minutes late for a round other than the first, they score zero for that round (and the opponent scores 30).
   * If there is an odd number of players, one player may receive a Bye. In the first round of the tournament the Bye is chosen at random and receives 40 points. In the subsequent rounds the Bye receives 30 points.
SETUP AND TERRAIN
Each battleplan will use terrain maps from the General’s Handbook. The GHB offers alternative maps for each battleplan, and this tournament will allow the defender to choose which map to use.  This pack contains a set of terrain maps mimicking those from the GHB. The missions outlined in this pack will indicate which of the maps are appropriate for the mission, with the GHB’s default map noted in red.
 The rules for setup are then:
The players roll off. The winner chooses which player is the attacker and which is the defender.
Next, both players set up the objectives in the locations indicated by gold circles on the battlefield map. Then, the defender selects which terrain map to use, and sets up the terrain features according to the selected map. The defender may choose which piece of terrain will count as each terrain type designated by the map.  Each terrain feature must be set up more than 3” from the battlefield edge, more than 3” from all objectives and more than 6” from all other terrain features.
After objectives and terrain have been set up, the attacker picks which territory is their territory. The other territory is the defender’s territory. The players then resolve the deployment phase. The attacker begins deployment.


Note we will change Unstable to:

Models cannot move across or be set up on or end any type of move on any part of this terrain feature that is more than 1” tall.

EVENT FAQ
For this event, we will be ruling on the subsequent issues as follows. We consulted Games Workshop on rules intent; however, these are not official rulings and should not be treated as such.


Q: Are Companion weapons affected by friendly abilities which add or modify other weapon abilities on that weapon?
A: No.
 
Q: When checking if a unit is behind a terrain feature, do I need to draw a line from base to base, or from any point on the attacking model to any point on the target? 
A: Any point to any point.


Q: How does Strike-first interact with abilities that allow another unit to fight immediately after?
A: If there are any units with Strike-first that have not yet fought, you can’t pick a unit that does not have Strike-first to fight. If there are no other Strike-first units, you could fight with a Strike-first unit, then use an ability to fight immediately with another unit, then if you were the active player you would pick the next unit to fight after that.


Q: When using ‘Power Through’, can you pass through enemy models?
A: Not unless you fly or have another ability that allows you to do so.


Q: Do abilities which modify ‘run rolls’ affect the roll made when using ‘Redeploy’?
A: No. 


Q: Can a unit use the 'Covering Fire' command after using the 'Redeploy' command?
A: Yes.


Q: If an ability allows a unit to score critical hits on an unmodified roll of 5+, but that unit needs a 6 to hit, would unmodified hit rolls of 5 hit the target, and if so would they still trigger any critical hit effects?
A: The roll is not a hit, but Crit (Mortal) is still triggered.


Daughters of Khaine
Q: Can I use the 'All-out Slaughter' ability once per battle with each eligible unit?


A: Yes. This ability is used by the unit, not the player, so each unit can use it once per battle (since it does not have the 'Once Per Battle (Army)' timing).


Gloomspite Gitz
Q: Does the 'Bouncing Fury' ability have any effect on Companion weapons? 
A: Yes. Every weapon specifically named in the ability is a Companion weapon.


Lumineth Realm Lords
Q: If my battle formation allows me to use a Facet of War ability in addition to the one I pick each round, can I pick the same Facet of War ability in order to use it twice that round?
A: No.


Q: If a Scinari Calligrave rolls a miscast when attempting to summon a manifestation, can they use the 'Realmscribe' ability to avoid the miscast?
A: No.




In addition to the above rules clarifications, we have also decided to introduce the following rules changes. 


Cities of Sigmar
Battle Traits: Add the following sentence to the declare step of 'Advance in Formation': 'You cannot pick the same unit as a target of this ability more than once in each phase.'


Disciples of Tzeentch
Battle Traits: Add the sentence ‘You cannot pick a Manifestation or Faction Terrain to be the target of this ability.’ to ‘Wyrdflame’.


Fyreslayers
Battle Traits: Change timing of 'Rune of Relentless Zeal' to 'Your Movement Phase'.


Kharadron Overlords
Arkanaut Frigate:  Change the second sentence of the declare step of 'Assault Boat' declare step to 'Pick a number of units up to its Transport Capacity that are wholly within 6" of it, are not in combat, and have not charged this turn to be targets.' Change the effect to: ‘This unit can move a distance up to the value of the charge roll and must end the move within ½" of a visible enemy unit. If it does so, remove the targets from the battlefield. Then, set up the targets wholly within this unit’s combat range. The targets must be set up in combat and have Strike-first for the rest of the turn. This unit and the targets have charged.’


Maggotkin of Nurgle
Battle Traits: Add the sentence ‘You cannot pick a Manifestation or Faction Terrain to be the target of this ability.’ to Disease.


Malign Sorcery
Purple Sun of Shyish, Suffocating Gravetide, Lauchon the Soulseeker: Add the sentence ‘This Manifestation can pass through models and the combat ranges of enemy units, but it cannot end that move in combat.’ to the abilities ‘End Given Form’, ‘Pulled to the Grave’, and ‘Traverse the Tides of Death’. Note this does not prevent them from leaving combat with their own movement abilities (and they are able to subsequently charge).


Nighthaunt
Change Hexwraiths control characteristic to 1.




Ossiarch Bonereapers
Immortis Guard: Change the beginning of the second sentence of 'Soulbound Protectors' to: 'However, each time you make an unmodified ward roll of 1...'


Stormcast Eternals
Dais Arcanum:  Replace the final sentence with:
'If the unit on the platform is removed from the battlefield, this Manifestation is removed from play. If the unit on the platform is picked to make a pile-in move, move this manifestation instead of the unit. While a unit is on the platform, it has the Fly keyword.'

Appendix: CHESS CLOCK RULES
The purpose of the clock
   * Full games of Age of Sigmar are expected to finish within the 3-hour round time limit. 
   * The purpose of a chess clock is to ensure a full game can be played and encourage speedy resolution of in-game actions. The chess clock is meant to ensure a roughly equal distribution of time between two players. Chess clocks should not be thought of as an easy way to auto-win a game or a way to time your opponent out.
   * If one player requests a chess clock be used at a table, both players must use and abide by these chess clock rules. 
   * If you do not have a chess clock, approach a TO to request a chess clock for your table.
How to use a chess clock
   * Below you will find guidelines on how to use a chess clock. In Age of Sigmar, each player takes actions in the other player's turn; therefore, these guidelines should not be thought of as a perfect measure of each player’s time used during a game but rather a way to ensure a roughly equal distribution of time between players.
Pre-game
   * The clock should be started as soon as the roll to decide attacker and defender is made (i.e. before deployment).
   * The clock time runs off of the defender’s time as they place terrain on the board (but after choice of terrain types have been determined [see TERRAIN section above]); time is passed to the attacker as they pick sides and make their first deployment. Once all of the models from the attacker's first deployment are placed on the table, time is passed to the defender and their first deployment is made. Time is then passed back to the attacker. This procedure is alternated until all units are deployed.
   * If a player is setting up a large unit, the opponent can choose to switch the clock and start setting up their own unit. For example, Player A starts setting up 40 clanrats and starts their clock. After 10 rats are placed, it is obvious where the remaining 30 will go, so player B switches the clock to their time and sets up their own unit.  Player A finishes setting up the rats on player B’s time (unless B finishes setup before the 30 are down). Players should be encouraged to take actions simultaneously if possible. 
   * Who takes the first turn is determined by the player who finished deploying first and the clock runs on their time while the decision is being made.
During the game
   * By default, the clock runs off the time of the player who is taking their turn. 
   * During a player’s turn, time is passed to the player not taking their turn when the following scenarios occur.
   1. If the player not taking their turn wishes to use an ability during the other player's turn, time is passed to that player while this ability is being resolved and then once resolved time is passed back to the player currently taking their turn.
   2. When a player makes a roll of any kind (such as a save roll), time is passed to the player making the roll.
   3. If the player not taking their turn inquiries about the rules of the player of the who is taking their turn army, time is passed to the player not taking their turn until the rules are explained.
   * However, if possible, and if both players agree, either player may take actions whilst another player is also taking an action. For example, a player may start rolling their next attack at the same time as their opponent is removing casualties from the previous attack. 
   * A player may always choose to forgo rolling to determine the results of a combat, starting with the player whose turn it is. If they choose to save their time this way, their opponent may decide the results of the combat. This can range from leaving the enemy unit unharmed, up to removing the entire unit involved in the combat. This must be decided before any rolls are made in the combat.
   * Any major rule dispute results in a paused time scenario. The time is to remain paused until a formal judge is called to the table and resolves the dispute.
   * A player who has ran out of time may no longer use ATTACK abilities or any abilities that are not mandatory. They may finish resolving an ability that they are in the process of using, and will still benefit from passive abilities.
